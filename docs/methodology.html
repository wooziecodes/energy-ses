    <h1>Methodology</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The aim was to construct and evaluate a borough-level normal linear regression model of mean household energy consumption (measured in kWh per meter) according to median income of taxpayers, mean domestic energy efficiency rating, mean people per household.</p>
    
    <p>This regression model would facilitate measuring the effect of changes in median income of taxpayers on the mean household energy consumption, while controlling for mean domestic energy efficiency ratings and mean people per household.</p>

    <p>As explained later, under the heading 'assessing electricity data', we decided to pivot our research question to focus only on gas consumption, because the electricity data were not suitable for a rigorous regression analysis within our skillset. In the sections that follow we will discuss other methodological challenges we encountered throughout the analysis, and how we worked to overcome these. The data we aimed to analyse proved complex, as much real-world data is. We worked to maintain the integrity of the data, and throughout the following sections of the website we critically discuss how manipulating the data to fit the assumptions of our regression analysis would affect the models' interpretability and usefulness.</p>

    <p>Alpha is set at the conventional level of 0.05 for all statistical tests in this analysis.</p>

    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Mean domestic gas consumption (kWh per meter) (over the year) - 2023</li>
        <li>Mean domestic electricity consumption (kWh per meter) (over the year) - 2023</li>
        <li>Median Personal incomes of taxpayers (before tax) (GBP) (over the year) - 2021/22</li>
        <li>Estimated mean people per household - 2021</li>
        <li>Estimated mean domestic energy efficiency rating (1-100 rating) - 2021</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Data Sources</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (2024): Domestic gas consumption</li>
        <li>Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (2024a): Domestic electricity consumption</li>
        <li>Greater London Authority (2024): Personal incomes of taxpayers</li>
        <li>Office for National Statistics (ONS) (2024a): People per household</li>
        <li>Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (MHCLG) (2021): Domestic energy efficiency ratings</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Borough level data was used because household level data are not available for all relevant variables. This means that we are considering average values for each borough for each of the variables.</p>

    <p>All coding was done in google colab. Data files were downloaded from government websites, and opened as MS Excel files. For each data file, some preprocessing was carried out in Excel, including selecting only the spreadsheet with the most recent year, and selecting only data from London boroughs. The files were then uploaded to google drive and mounted into the colab page.</p>

    <h2>Data Wrangling and Cleaning</h2>
    
    <h3>Calculating Estimated Mean People per Household</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Household size data was given as number of households in each borough with 1,2,3,4 or 5+ members</li>
        <li>For each borough we needed the average number of people per household in each borough. We used the method recommended by the United States Census Bureau (2020): calculating a weighted mean from the distribution of household sizes.</li>
        <li>We calculated an estimate of the total people in all households in the borough by multiplying the number of households in each size category by the household size. For households with 5+ people, we used the multiplier of 5.5 people per household to account for households that are larger.</li>
        <li>We then calculated the total households by summing the number of households in each size category.</li>
        <li>We divided the total people by the total households.</li>
        <li>We looped through this process for each borough and added a column to our dataframe called 'estimated mean people per household'</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
# Calculate and add 'mean people per household' column to people_per_household
# first, create new column and initialize with 0
people_per_household['mean people per household'] = 0

#loop through according to index to calc total number of people per household and total number of households in each borough
for index in people_per_household.index:
    #calc total number of people per borough
    total_people = (
        1 * people_per_household.loc[index, 'households with 1 person'] +
        2 * people_per_household.loc[index, 'households with 2 people'] +
        3 * people_per_household.loc[index, 'households with 3 people'] +
        4 * people_per_household.loc[index, 'households with 4 people'] +
        5.5 * people_per_household.loc[index, 'households with 5+ people']
        #5.5 used as for 5+ people households
    )

    # calc total number of households per borough
    total_households = (

        people_per_household.loc[index, 'households with 4 people'] +
        people_per_household.loc[index, 'households with 5+ people']
    )

    #finally, calc mean by dividing the total people by total households
    if total_households != 0:
        people_per_household.loc[index, 'mean people per household'] = total_people / total_households
        </pre>
    </div>

    <h3>Calculating Estimated Mean Domestic Energy Efficiency Rating</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We needed to carry out a similar process to the household size data with the domestic energy efficiency ratings.</li>
        <li>The efficiency data was given as the number of households in each borough with ratings of A,B,C,D,E,F or G. These categorical labels represent intervals of efficiency ratings on a scale from 1-100. [A = 92-100, B = 81-91, C = 69-80, D = 55-68, E = 39-54, F = 21-38, G = 1-20]</li>
        <li>We calculated a weighted mean of domestic energy efficiency ratings in each borough by multiplying the number of households in each category by the mean score represented by that category.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
# Add 'estimated mean dwelling energy rating' per household' column and inititalise with 0
energy_rating['estimated mean dwelling energy rating'] = 0

#calculate the estimated mean energy rating by dividing total energy rating by total dwellings

for index in energy_rating.index:
    #total energy ratings estimated by finding the average of each bracket, and then multiplying by number of dwellings in that bracket
    total_ratings = (

        ((1+20)/2) * energy_rating.loc[index,'G:1-20']
    )
    total_dwellings = (
        #total dwellings calculated by summing all dwellings with different ratings

    )

    #calculate estimated mean dwelling energy rating for the borough
    if total_households != 0:

        </pre>
    </div>
    <p>For each of the 5 datasets, the data were cleaned in order to eventually be merged into a single dataframe. The common data cleaning included the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Removal of excess rows containing headings or other information (from excel layout)</li>
        <li>Changing column names (for ease of understanding, and to match between dfs so that merge can take place)</li>
        <li>Removing columns of excess data not being used in analysis</li>
        <li>Resetting index</li>
        <li>Removal of commas and making all values numeric</li>
    </ol>

    <p>There were no missing data in any of the datasets.</p>

    <h2>Example Code for Data Cleaning on Mean Gas Consumption Data</h2>
    <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
# reading in gas data from google drive
gas = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/FINALQM2/filtered_gas_consumption_2022.csv')

#cleaning gas dataframe

# rename local authority as 'Area' to match other dfs
gas = gas.rename(columns={'Local authority':'Area'})
# add index
gas = gas.reset_index(drop=True)
# drop excess columns
gas = gas.drop(columns=['Code', 'Country or region', 'Notes'])
# rename columns
gas = gas.rename(columns={
    'Total consumption\n(GWh):\nDomestic\n':'GAS Total domestic consumption (GWh)', 
    'Mean consumption\n(kWh per meter):\nDomestic\n': 'GAS Mean domestic consumption (kWh per meter)',
    'Median consumption\n(kWh per meter):\nDomestic\n': 'GAS Median domestic consumption (kWh per meter)'
})

# Remove commas from all columns with string types (which should be numeric)
cols_commas = ['GAS Total domestic consumption (GWh)', 
               'GAS Mean domestic consumption (kWh per meter)', 
               'GAS Median domestic consumption (kWh per meter)']

for col in cols_commas:
    if gas[col].dtype == object:  # Check if column is of object type 
        gas[col] = gas[col].str.replace(',', '')

# Convert to numeric after removing commas
for col in cols_commas:
    gas[col] = pd.to_numeric(gas[col], errors='coerce').fillna(0)

gas.head()

    <h2>Statistical Analysis</h2>

    </div>

    <h2>Removing the City of London</h2>
    <p>We suspected that the City of London may not be a useful data point because it has an extremely small population (8600 people according to the 2021 Census) and is very wealthy. The outlier in the median income histogram represents the City of London (median taxpayer earns 62200 GBP). The CoL also has the smallest mean number of people per household, visible to the left of the first histogram. Since CoL has such a small population and these extreme demographics, it could have a disproportionately large influence on our findings. For this reason we decided to exclude it from our data.</p>

    <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
#create a new dataframe without the City of London (CoL)
df_without_CoL = merged_df[merged_df['Area'] != 'City of London']
        </pre>
    </div>

    <h2>Thinking About Assumptions</h2>
    <p>We intended to construct two normal linear ordinary least squares regression models for energy consumption - one with electricity consumption as the response and the other with gas consumption as the response. For both models the covariates would be median income, mean dwelling energy efficiency and mean people per household.</p>

    <p>In order to construct the models, however, we needed to ensure that we would be able to satisfy the assumptions for normal linear regression:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Linearity</li>
        <li>Normality of the errors</li>
        <li>Homoscedasticity of the errors</li>
        <li>Independence of the errors</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Assessing Distribution of Electricity Consumption Data</h2>
    <p>The first concern when examining the distributions of the variables, was the non-normality of the electricity data. While normal linear models do not assume that the response variable itself is normally distributed (only the error term of the model), the multimodal distribution of the electricity data raises serious concerns about whether this assumption could be met.</p>

    <p>Our first attempt at normalising the mean electricity consumption data was by applying different transformations to the data and examining the resulting distributions.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="/api/placeholder/600/450" alt="Transformations of Electricity Data">
    </div>

    <p>As shown, none of the transformations substantially normalised the data. All of the plots show bimodal density functions.</p>

    <h2>Variable Transformations Code</h2>
    <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
# Define the formula for the multiple linear regression model
formula = 'Q("GAS Mean domestic consumption (kWh per meter)") ~ Median_Income_Centered + Mean_People_Centered + Q("estimated mean dwelling energy rating") + Median_Income_Centered*Mean_People_Centered + Q("estimated mean dwelling energy rating")*Median_Income_Centered'
# for column names with spaces in them need to use Q("")

model = smf.ols(formula=formula1, data=df_without_CoL).fit()

# Print the summary of the regression
print(model.summary())
        </pre>
    </div>

    <h2>Addressing Multicollinearity</h2>
    <p>The matrix plot illuminated a potential violation of the assumption that the errors of the model must be independent. The strong correlation (r = -0.84) between the mean people per household and median income indicates that there is collinearity between two of the covariates.</p>

    <p>Variance inflation factor is a measure used to estimate multicollinearity between covariates variables. A VIF of 5 or more suggests that multicollinearity is present, and VIFs above ten indicate serious collinearity (Kim, 2019).</p>

    <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
# Define the covariates
covariates = ["Median income", "mean people per household", "estimated mean dwelling energy rating"]

# Create a DataFrame with only the covariates
X = df_without_CoL[covariates]

# Calculate VIF for each covariate
vif_data = pd.DataFrame()
vif_data["Variable"] = X.columns
vif_data["VIF"] = [variance_inflation_factor(X.values, i) for i in range(X.shape[1])]

# Print the VIF data
print(vif_data)
        </pre>
    </div>

    <p>The output shows extremely high VIFs, indicating very serious multicollinearity:</p>
    <pre>
                                    Variable         VIF
0                           Median income    122.145741
1                mean people per household    183.174208
2    estimated mean dwelling energy rating    499.896117
    </pre>

    <p>To address this, we centered the variables on their means:</p>

    <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
# Center variables
df_without_CoL['Median_Income_Centered'] = df_without_CoL['Median income'] - df_without_CoL['Median income'].mean()
df_without_CoL['Mean_People_Centered'] = df_without_CoL['mean people per household'] - df_without_CoL['mean people per household'].mean()
        </pre>
    </div>

    <h2>Testing Model Assumptions</h2>
    <p>We need to test several key assumptions of our linear regression model:</p>

    <h3>Normality Check</h3>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="assets/meth_imgs/image3.png" alt="Q-Q Plot">
    </div>
    <p>The Q-Q plot shows reasonably good alignment with the theoretical normal distribution, though there are some deviations at the extremes.</p>

    <h3>Homoscedasticity Check</h3>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="assets/meth_imgs/image5.png" alt="Residuals vs Fitted Values Plot">
    </div>
    <p>The residuals vs fitted values plot shows relatively even spread around zero, suggesting homoscedasticity is a reasonable assumption.</p>

    <h2>Final Model Results</h2>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="assets/meth_imgs/image9.png" alt="Final Model Results Table">
    </div>

    <h2>Model Interpretation</h2>
    <p>The final model results show:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>R-squared value of 0.678, indicating the model explains about 67.8% of the variance in gas consumption</li>
        <li>All coefficients are statistically significant (p < 0.05)</li>
        <li>The interaction terms are significant, suggesting the relationship between income and gas consumption is moderated by both household size and energy efficiency</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Limitations and Future Work</h2>
    <p>While our model provides valuable insights, several limitations should be noted:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Borough-level aggregation may mask individual household </li>
        <li>The data spans different time periods (2021-2023)</li>
        <li>We were unable to include electricity consumption due to its non-normal distribution</li>
    </ul>
